# Android malware datasets

List some android malware datasets in academic research.Some of them are still up to date.

> **I got more 20GB VirusTotal Academic Malware Samples(8GB 2017-10 and 15GB 2018-3) . I am pleased to share these samples if you want to use in academic research.I also get the Contagio's password too.**
>
> 1. 我这里有Drebin的数据集，以及2017-10和2018-3月VirusTotal的android恶意样本，超过20GB。VirusTotal的数据集在Google云盘上。需要的可以联系我。
> 2. 历史的数据集例如Drebin、Genome 等可以联系导师，然后发邮件联系他们获取，一些不再共享的也可以联系一些已经拥有数据集的大学和机构，基本上国内知名的大学都会有这些数据集。
> 3. VirusTotal的样本可以自己去申请。分为API和恶意文件夹。前者可以等到详细的样本检测报告，后者的话主要是大量的恶意样本。但是VirusTotal样本申请需要填写大量的信息，例如身份、研究的内容、学校和导师的资料等。
> 4. Contagio样本的密码，直接联系博主本人即可。

## [Android Malware Genome Project](http://www.malgenomeproject.org/)

> (2015/12/21) Due to limited resources and the situation that students involving in this project have graduated, **we decide to stop the efforts of malware dataset sharing**.

**Description:** In this project, we focus on the Android platform and aim to systematize or characterize existing Android malware. Particularly, with more than one year effort, we have managed to collect more than 1,200 malware samples that cover the majority of existing Android malware families, ranging from their debut in August 2010 to recent ones in October 2011.

**Sample Volume:** more than 1,200

**Collected Time:** 2010.8 - 2011.10

**Way to get:** ask someone who had already get this dataset. [following universities, research labs and companies](http://www.malgenomeproject.org/policy.html)


## [Kharon Malware Dataset](http://kharon.gforge.inria.fr/dataset/)

**Description:** The Kharon dataset is a collection of malware totally reversed and documented. This dataset has been constructed to help us to evaluate our research experiments. Its construction has required a huge amount of work to understand the malicous code, trigger it and then construct the documentation. This dataset is now available for research purpose, we hope it will help you to lead your own experiments.
